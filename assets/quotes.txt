I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.
What do you despise? By this are you truly known.
This wise man observed that wealth is a tool of freedom. But the pursuit of wealth is the way to slavery.
When I am weaker than you, I ask you for Freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles.
The slow knife penetrates the shield.
There is no escape — we pay for the violence of our ancestors.
When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late.
Hope clouds observation.
It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.
The mind can go either direction under stress — toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.
He who controls the spice controls the universe.
Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.
A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.
Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.
The people who can destroy a thing, they control it.
Survival is the ability to swim in strange water.
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You'll find me there, staring out at you!
Arrakis teaches the attitude of the knife - chopping off what's incomplete and saying: 'Now, it's complete because it's ended here.
What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises — no matter the mood! Mood's a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset. It's not for fighting.
Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power," Tuek said. "You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to be too sharp and quick.
Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things..." she held up four big-knuckled fingers. "...the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these things are as nothing..." She closed her fingers into a fist. "...without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!
The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called "spannungsbogen" - which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.
Highly organized research is guaranteed to produce nothing new.
Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.
There should be a science of discontent. People need hard times to develop psychic muscles.
The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows - a wall against the wind.
There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man - with human flesh.
The child who refuses to travel in the father's harness, this is the symbol of man's most unique capability. 'I do not have to be what my father was. I do not have to obey my father's rules or even believe everything he believed. It is my strength as a human that I can make my own choices of what to believe and what not to believe, of what to be and what not to be.'
“Give as few orders as possible," his father had told him once long ago. "Once you've given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on that subject.”
My father once told me that respect for truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. "Something cannot emerge from nothing," he said. This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable 'the truth' can be.
There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace - these qualities you find always in that the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush of the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and in our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move towards death.
Beyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom diminishes as numbers increase. This is as true of humans as it is of gas molecules in a sealed flask. The human question is not how many can possibly survive within the system, but what kind of existence is possible for those who so survive.
The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.
Any man who retreats into a cave which has only one opening deserves to die.
How often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him.
Do you wrestle with dreams? Do you contend with shadows? Do you move in a kind of sleep? Time has slipped away. Your life is stolen. You tarried with trifles, Victim of your folly.
We faced it and did not resist. The storm passed through us and around us. It's gone, but we remain.
Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it. But it’s a human trait that when we encounter personal problems, these things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our logic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual, deep-seated thing that’s really chewing on us.
A killer with the manners of a rabbit - this is the most dangerous kind.
Then, as his planet killed him, it occurred to Kynes that his father and all the other scientists were wrong, that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error.
But it's well known that repression makes a religion flourish.
Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves, 'I am not the kind of person I want to be.' It must never sink into an assemblage of the self-satisfied.
Knowing where the trap is — that's the first step in evading it.
To endure oneself may be the hardest task in the universe.
How easy it is to mistake clear reasoning from correct reasoning!
Here lies a toppled God. His fall was not a small one. We did but build his pedestal. A narrow and a tall one.
All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible.
"Every judgement teeters on the brink of error," Leto explained. "To claim absolute knowledge is to become monstrous. Knowledge is an unending adventure on the edge of uncertainty."
Show me a completely smooth operation and I'll show you someone who's covering mistakes. Real boats rock.
Your semen is your own, to do with as you please.
We sift people to find the humans.
If wishes were fishes, we'd all cast nets.
Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. Seek discipline and find your liberty.
If I am the flame, be the coal. If i am the dew, be the water.
You see, gentlemen, they have something to die for. They've discovered they're a people. They're awakening.
Many have marked the speed with which Muad'Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.
What senses do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?
Much that was called religion has carried an unconscious attitude of hostility toward life. True religion must teach that life is filled with joys pleasing to the eye of God, that knowledge without action is empty. All men must see that the teaching of religion by rules and rote is largely a hoax. The proper teaching is recognized with ease. You can know it without fail because it awakens within you that sensation which tells you this is something you’ve always known.
Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.
Paradise on my right, Hell on my left and the Angel of Death behind.
No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero.
The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.
If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.
The thing the ecologically illiterate don't realise about an ecosystem is that it's a system. A system! A system maintains a certain fluid stability that can be destroyed by a misstep in just one niche. A system has order, flowing from point to point. If something dams that flow, order collapses. The untrained might miss that collapse until it was too late. That's why the highest function of ecology is the understanding of consequences.
For now is my grief heavier than the sands of the seas, she thought. This world has emptied me of all but the oldest purpose: tomorrow's life.
Mankind has only one science... its the science of discontent.
It's easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire.
Think on it, Chani: the princess will have the name, yet she'll live as less than a concubine - never to know a moment of tenderness from the man to whom she's bound. While we, Chani, we who carry the name of concubine - history will call us wives.
The test of a man isn’t what you think he’ll do. It’s what he actually does.
I am like a person whose hands were kept numb, without sensation from the first moment of awareness - until one day the ability to feel is forced into them. And I say "Look! I have no hands!" But the people all around me say: "What are hands?
Humans are almost always lonely.
Law is the ultimate science.
A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.
When you imagine mistakes, there can be no self-defense.
I see us giving love to each other in a time of quiet between storms. It's what we were meant to do.
A man's flesh is his own; the water belongs to the tribe.
The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it.
A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful.
There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that place within himself where the taking force dwells, but it’s almost impossible for him to see into the giving force without changing into something other than man. For a woman, the situation is reversed... These things are so ancient within us... that they’re ground into each separate cell of our bodies... It’s as easy to be overwhelmed by giving as by taking.
Growth is limited by the necessity which is present in the least amount. And naturally, the least favorable condition controls the growth rate.
What is important for a leader is that which makes him a leader. It is the needs of his people.
Polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert.
My lungs taste the air of Time, blown past falling sands...
When he wanted, he could radiate charm and sincerity, but I often wonder in these later days if anything about him was as it seemed. I think now he was a man fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage.
“There’s a Bene Gesserit saying,” she said. “You have sayings for everything!” he protested. “You’ll like this one,” she said. “It goes: Do not count a human dead until you’ve seen his body. And even then you can make a mistake.”
Leto turned a hard stare at Kynes. And Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had observed here: This Duke was concerned more over the men than he was over the spice. He risked his own life, and that of his son to save the men. He passed off the loss of a spice crawler with a gesture. The threat to men's lives had him in a rage. A leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat. Against his own will and all previous judgements, Kynes admitted to himself: I like this Duke.
I should like friendship with you... and trust. I should like that respect for each other which grows in the breast without demand for the huddlings of sex.
It occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a moment. There was no mercy where there could be no stopping.
Maud’Dib could indeed, see the Future, but you must understand the limits of this power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond the valley. Just so, Maud’Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us “The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.” And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning “That path leads ever down into stagnation.
Science is made up of so many things that appear obvious after they are explained.
I should've suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive.
Prophets have a way of dying by violence.
Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.
Desperate people are the most dangerous.
His voice was low, charged with unspeakable adjectives.
Never obliterate a man unthinkingly, the way an entire fief might do it through some due process of law. Always do it for an overriding purpose — and know your purpose!
Use the first moments in study. You may miss many an opportunity for quick victory this way, but the moments of study are insurance of success. Take your time and be sure.
A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.
TO THE LADY JESSICA - May this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me. Please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers: the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.
The meeting between ignorance and knowledge, between brutality and culture - it begins in the dignity with which we treat the dead.
We came from Caladan — a paradise world for our form of life. There existed no need on Caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mind — we could see the actuality all around us. And the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this life — we went soft, we lost our edge.
What is the son but an extension of the father?

I should’ve suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive.
There's steel in this man that no one has taken the temper out of...
A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Maud'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Maud'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.
The night is a tunnel, she thought, a hole into tomorrow...
The day hums sweetly when you have enough bees working for you.
O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers.
Scientists seek the lawfulness of events. It is the task of Religion to fit man into this lawfulness.
Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.
Respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. Something cannot emerge from nothing.
God created Arrakis to train the faithful.
The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.
When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.
A ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel... he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men... a good ruler has to learn his world's language... it's different for every world... the language of the rocks and growing things... the language you don't hear just with your ears... The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.... Understanding must move with the flow of the process.
The universe is full of doors.
She thought of the boy's features as an exquisite distillation out of random patterns - endless queues of happenstance meeting at this nexus.
I observed you in pain, lad. Pain’s merely the axis of the test. Your mother’s told you about our ways of observing. I see the signs of her teaching in you. Our test is crisis and observation.
“Are you already training my replacement? Piter demanded. "Replace you? Why, Piter, where could I find another Mentat with your cunning and venom?" "The same place you found me, Baron." "Perhaps I should at that," the Baron mused. "You do seem a bit unstable lately. And the spice you eat!" "Are my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them?" "My dear Piter, your pleasures are what tie you to me. How could I object to that?”
When strangers meet, great allowances should be made for differences in custom and training.
The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness.
One should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt.
“You must teach me someday how you do that,” he said. “The way you thrust your worries aside and turn to practical matters. It must be a Bene Gesserit thing.” “It’s a female thing,” she said.

You’ve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? There’s an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove the threat to his kind.
