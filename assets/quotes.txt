I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.
What do you despise? By this are you truly known.
This wise man observed that wealth is a tool of freedom. But the pursuit of wealth is the way to slavery.
Night held its fear smells and its things which came with slithering sounds.
Enemies strengthen you. Allies weaken you.
When I am weaker than you, I ask you for Freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles.
The slow knife penetrates the shield.
It is said that there is a principle of conflict which originated with the single cell and has never deteriorated.
To know the future absolutely it to be trapped into that future absolutely. It collapses time. Present becomes future.
The act of saying that things exist that cannot be described in words shakes a universe where words are the supreme belief.
Time is a measure of space, just as a range-finder is a measure of space, but measuring locks us into the place we measure.
No matter how much we ask after the truth, self-awareness is often unpleasant. We do not feel kindly toward the Truthsayer.
The ultimate test... to see the good in evil and the evil in good.
Evil can be detected by its smell.
Silence is often the best thing to say.
Order generally was a product of human activity. Chaos existed as a raw material from which to create order.
Revenge is for children and the emotionally retarded.
Logic is good for playing chess but is often too slow for the needs of survival.
Unused power was like a marionette with visible strings, nobody holding them. A compelling attraction: I could make it dance.
Paired opposites define your longings and those longings imprison you.
What greater gift is there than to demonstrate you need not fear death?
Words themselves were the ultimate barrier to revelation.
Death makes a prophet's voice louder.
What do such machines really do? They increase the number of things we can do without thinking. Things we do without thinking - there's the real danger.
Constitutions become the ultimate tyranny... They're organized power on such a scale as to be overwhelming. The constitution is social power mobilized and it has no conscience. It can crush the highest and the lowest, removing all dignity and individuality. It has an unstable balance point and no limitations.
War is behavior with roots in the single cell of the primeval seas. Eat whatever you touch or it will eat you.
Politics: the art of appearing candid and completely open while concealing as much as possible.
Face your fears or they will climb over your back.
Try to hold on to youth and it mocks you while it sprints away.
Give me the judgment of balanced minds in preference to laws every time. Codes and manuals create patterned behavior. All patterned behavior tends to go unquestioned, gathering destructive momentum.
The oppressed always learned from and copied the oppressor. When the tables were turned, the stage was set for another round of revenge and violence - roles reversed. And reversed and reversed ad nauseam.
Ask what Infinity might produce and the only answer possible was, "Anything." Any good, any evil; any god, any devil.
Power attracts the corruptible. Suspect all who seek it.
The surest way to keep a secret is to make people believe they already know the answer.
It takes a pretty dull policeman to miss the fact that the position of authority is the most prosperous criminal position available.
Life cannot find reasons to sustain it, cannot be a source of decent mutual regard, unless each of us resolves to breathe such qualities into it.
Law always chooses sides on the basis of enforcement power. Morality and legal niceties have little to do with it when the real question is: Who has the clout?
We never completely escape the teachers of our childhood nor any of the patterns that formed us.
Bureaucracy destroys initiative. There is little that bureaucrats hate more than innovation, especially innovation that produces better results than the old routines. Improvements always make those at the top of the heap look inept. Who enjoys appearing inept?
Justice? Who asks for justice? We make our own justice... Let us not rail about justice as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them.
Caution is the path to mediocrity. Gliding passionless mediocrity is all that most people think they can achieve.
Some people never observe anything. Life just happens to them. They get by on little more than a kind of dumb persistence, and they resist with anger and resentment anything that might lift them out of that false serenity.
Philosophy is always dangerous because it promotes the creation of new ideas.
Producing perfection from imperfection is, after all, the highest of art forms.
Time can also be a place... Everything depends on where you are standing, on where you look or what you hear. The measure of it is found in consciousness itself.
Historians exercise great power and some of them know it. They recreate the past, changing it to fit their own interpretations. Thus, they change the future as well.
Fragmentation is the natural destiny of all power.
In all major socializing forces you will find an underlying movement to gain and maintain power through the use of words. From witch doctor to priest to bureaucrat it is all the same. A governed populace must be conditioned to accept power-words as actual things, to confuse the symbolized system with the tangible universe. In the maintenance of such a power structure, certain symbols are kept out of reach of common understanding - symbols such as those dealing with economic manipulation or those which define the local interpretation of sanity. Symbol-secrecy of this form leads to the development of fragmented sub-languages, each being a signal that its users are accumulating some form of power.
Justice required resort to law and that could be a fickle mistress, subject always to the whims and prejudices of those who administered the laws.
Atrocity is recognized as such by victim and perpetrator alike, by all who learn about it at whatever remove. Atrocity has no excuses, no mitigating argument. Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past. Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-perpetuating upon itself - a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred.
Governments, if they endure, always tend increasingly toward aristocratic forms. No government in history has been known to evade this pattern. And as the aristocracy develops, governments tend more and more to act exclusively in the interests of the ruling class - whether that class be hereditary royalty, oligarchs of financial empires, or entrenched bureaucracy.
Most civilization is based on cowardice. It's so easy to civilize by teaching cowardice. You water down the standards which would lead to bravery. You restrain the will. You regulate the appetites. You fence in the horizons. You make a law for every movement. You deny the existence of chaos. You teach even the children to breathe slowly. You tame.
One must cast off old agonies as a snake casts off its skin - only to grow a new set and accept all of their limitations.
There is no escape — we pay for the violence of our ancestors.
If we deny emotion, we lose all touch with our internal universe.
Infinity? It attracts us like a floodlight in the night.
Only gods can safely risk perfection... it's a dangerous thing for a man.
Words are such gross machinery, so primitive and ambiguous.
When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late.
Hope clouds observation.
It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.
The mind can go either direction under stress — toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.
He who controls the spice controls the universe.
Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.
A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.
Fear is the mind-killer.
We tend to become like the worst in those we oppose.
The mind goes on working no matter how we try to hold it back.
The unclouded eye was better, no matter what it saw.
Each life creates endless ripples.
Short-term expediency always fails in the long run.
Humiliation is a thing which no person can forget.
You were taught to believe that loyalty buys loyalty. Ohh, Duncan, do not believe in history, because history is impelled by whatever passes for money.
Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.
Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.
The people who can destroy a thing, they control it.
The dice cannot read their own spots.
Survival is the ability to swim in strange water.
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You'll find me there, staring out at you!
People are the true strength of a Great House.
Arrakis teaches the attitude of the knife - chopping off what's incomplete and saying: "Now, it's complete because it's ended here."
What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises — no matter the mood! Mood's a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset. It's not for fighting.
Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power," Tuek said. "You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to be too sharp and quick.
Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things..." she held up four big-knuckled fingers. "...the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these things are as nothing..." She closed her fingers into a fist. "...without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!
The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called "spannungsbogen" - which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.
Highly organized research is guaranteed to produce nothing new.
Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.
There should be a science of discontent. People need hard times to develop psychic muscles.
The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows - a wall against the wind. This is the willow's purpose.
There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man - with human flesh.
The child who refuses to travel in the father's harness, this is the symbol of man's most unique capability. 'I do not have to be what my father was. I do not have to obey my father's rules or even believe everything he believed. It is my strength as a human that I can make my own choices of what to believe and what not to believe, of what to be and what not to be.'
“Give as few orders as possible," his father had told him once long ago. "Once you've given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on that subject.”
My father once told me that respect for truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. "Something cannot emerge from nothing," he said. This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable 'the truth' can be.
There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace - these qualities you find always in that the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush of the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and in our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move towards death.
Beyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom diminishes as numbers increase. This is as true of humans as it is of gas molecules in a sealed flask. The human question is not how many can possibly survive within the system, but what kind of existence is possible for those who so survive.
The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.
Any man who retreats into a cave which has only one opening deserves to die.
Humans must never submit to animals.
How often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him.
Do you wrestle with dreams? Do you contend with shadows? Do you move in a kind of sleep? Time has slipped away. Your life is stolen. You tarried with trifles, Victim of your folly.
We faced it and did not resist. The storm passed through us and around us. It's gone, but we remain.
Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it. But it’s a human trait that when we encounter personal problems, these things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our logic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual, deep-seated thing that’s really chewing on us.
A killer with the manners of a rabbit - this is the most dangerous kind.
Then, as his planet killed him, it occurred to Kynes that his father and all the other scientists were wrong, that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error.
But it's well known that repression makes a religion flourish.
Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves, 'I am not the kind of person I want to be.' It must never sink into an assemblage of the self-satisfied.
Knowing where the trap is — that's the first step in evading it.
To endure oneself may be the hardest task in the universe.
When a creature has developed into one thing, he will choose death rather than change into his opposite.
I don't speak... I operate a machine called language. It creaks and groans, but is mine own.
How easy it is to mistake clear reasoning from correct reasoning!
Here lies a toppled God. His fall was not a small one. We did but build his pedestal. A narrow and a tall one.
All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible.
"Every judgement teeters on the brink of error," Leto explained. "To claim absolute knowledge is to become monstrous. Knowledge is an unending adventure on the edge of uncertainty."
Show me a completely smooth operation and I'll show you someone who's covering mistakes. Real boats rock.
Your semen is your own, to do with as you please.
There's a lesson in every temptation.
One observes the survivors and learns from them.
When we try to conceal our innermost drives, the entire being screams betrayal.
Men always fear things which move by themselves.
Words can carry any burden we wish. All that's required is agreement and a tradition upon which to build.
Too much knowledge never makes for simple decisions.
Ambitions tend to remain undisturbed by realities.
If you live in bad faith, lies will appear to you like the truth.
It is not the present which unfluences the future, thou fool, but the future which forms the present. You have it all backward. Since the future is set, an unfolding of events which will assure that future is fixed and inevitable.
We sift people to find the humans.
If wishes were fishes, we'd all cast nets.
Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. Seek discipline and find your liberty.
People, not commercial organizations or chains of command, are what make great civilizations work. Every civilization depends upon the quality of the individuals it produces.
If I am the flame, be the coal. If I am the dew, be the water.
You see, gentlemen, they have something to die for. They've discovered they're a people. They're awakening.
Many have marked the speed with which Muad'Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.
What senses do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?
Much that was called religion has carried an unconscious attitude of hostility toward life. True religion must teach that life is filled with joys pleasing to the eye of God, that knowledge without action is empty. All men must see that the teaching of religion by rules and rote is largely a hoax. The proper teaching is recognized with ease. You can know it without fail because it awakens within you that sensation which tells you this is something you’ve always known.
Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.
Thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a human mind.
A requirement of creativity is that it contributes to change. Creativity keeps the creator alive.
Life is a game whose rules you learn if you leap into it and play it to the hilt. Otherwise, you are caught off balance, continually surprised by the shifting play. Non-players often whine and complain that luck always passes them by. They refuse to see that they can create some of their own luck.
Paradise on my right, Hell on my left and the Angel of Death behind.
When your opponent fears you, then's the moment when you give the fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him. Let it become terror. The terrified man fights himself. Eventually, he attacks in desperation. That is the most dangerous moment, but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal mistake.
No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero.
The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.
If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.
War is the most readily available form of chaos.
One uses power by grasping it lightly. To grasp too strongly is to be taken over by power, and thus to become its victim.
Power tends to isolate those who hold too much of it. Eventually, they lose touch with reality... and fall.
The joy of living, its beauty, is all bound up in the fact that life can surprise you.
The only past which endures lies wordlessly within you.
Some say that people cling to Imperial leadership because space is infinite. They feel lonely without a unifying symbol. For a lonely people, the Emperor is a definite place. They can turn toward him and say: "See, there He is. He makes us one." Perhaps religion serves the same purpose.
History is a constant race between invention and catastrophe.
There exists no separation between gods and men; one blends softly casual into the other.
Empires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation. It is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague ritual.
To come under siege... was the inevitable fate of power.
Reason is the first victim of strong emotion.
Command must always look confident. All that faith riding on your shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it.
I must rule with eye and claw - as the hawk among lesser birds.
Some things beggar likeness.
From water does all life begin.
I never wanted to be a god. I wanted only to disappear like a jewel of trace dew caught by the morning. I wanted to escape the angels and the damned - alone... as though an oversight.
The eye that looks ahead to the safe course is closed forever.
Motivating people, forcing them to your will, gives you a cynical attitude towards humanity. It degrades everything it touches.
The thing the ecologically illiterate don't realise about an ecosystem is that it's a system. A system! A system maintains a certain fluid stability that can be destroyed by a misstep in just one niche. A system has order, flowing from point to point. If something dams that flow, order collapses. The untrained might miss that collapse until it was too late. That's why the highest function of ecology is the understanding of consequences.
For now is my grief heavier than the sands of the seas, she thought. This world has emptied me of all but the oldest purpose: tomorrow's life.
Mankind has only one science... its the science of discontent.
It's easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire.
Think on it, Chani: the princess will have the name, yet she'll live as less than a concubine - never to know a moment of tenderness from the man to whom she's bound. While we, Chani, we who carry the name of concubine - history will call us wives.
The test of a man isn’t what you think he’ll do. It’s what he actually does.
I am like a person whose hands were kept numb, without sensation from the first moment of awareness - until one day the ability to feel is forced into them. And I say "Look! I have no hands!" But the people all around me say: "What are hands?
Humans are almost always lonely.
Law is the ultimate science.
A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.
When you imagine mistakes, there can be no self-defense.
I see us giving love to each other in a time of quiet between storms. It's what we were meant to do.
A man's flesh is his own; the water belongs to the tribe.
The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it.
Humans live best when each has his place to stand, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things and what he may achieve. Destroy the place and you destroy the person.
A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful.
There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that place within himself where the taking force dwells, but it’s almost impossible for him to see into the giving force without changing into something other than man. For a woman, the situation is reversed... These things are so ancient within us... that they’re ground into each separate cell of our bodies... It’s as easy to be overwhelmed by giving as by taking.
Growth is limited by the necessity which is present in the least amount. And naturally, the least favorable condition controls the growth rate.
What is important for a leader is that which makes him a leader. It is the needs of his people.
Polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert.
My lungs taste the air of Time, blown past falling sands...
One makes a choice between dangers.
To suspect your own mortality is to know the beginning of terror; to learn irrefutably that you are mortal is to know the end of terror.
When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place, He causeth that creature's wants to direct him to that place.
When he wanted, he could radiate charm and sincerity, but I often wonder in these later days if anything about him was as it seemed. I think now he was a man fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage.
“There’s a Bene Gesserit saying,” she said. “You have sayings for everything!” he protested. “You’ll like this one,” she said. “It goes: Do not count a human dead until you’ve seen his body. And even then you can make a mistake.”
Leto turned a hard stare at Kynes. And Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had observed here: This Duke was concerned more over the men than he was over the spice. He risked his own life, and that of his son to save the men. He passed off the loss of a spice crawler with a gesture. The threat to men's lives had him in a rage. A leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat. Against his own will and all previous judgements, Kynes admitted to himself: I like this Duke.
I should like friendship with you... and trust. I should like that respect for each other which grows in the breast without demand for the huddlings of sex.
It occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a moment. There was no mercy where there could be no stopping.
The Guild Navigators, gifted with limited prescience, had made the fatal decision: they'd chosen always the clear, safe course that leads ever downward to stagnation.
Maud’Dib could indeed, see the Future, but you must understand the limits of this power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond the valley. Just so, Maud’Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us “The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.” And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning “That path leads ever down into stagnation."
Science is made up of so many things that appear obvious after they are explained.
I should've suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive.
Prophets have a way of dying by violence.
Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.
Desperate people are the most dangerous.
His voice was low, charged with unspeakable adjectives.
Religion is but the most ancient and honorable way in which men have striven to make sense out of God's universe.
Never obliterate a man unthinkingly, the way an entire fief might do it through some due process of law. Always do it for an overriding purpose — and know your purpose!
Use the first moments in study. You may miss many an opportunity for quick victory this way, but the moments of study are insurance of success. Take your time and be sure.
A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.
TO THE LADY JESSICA - May this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me. Please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers: the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.
The meeting between ignorance and knowledge, between brutality and culture - it begins in the dignity with which we treat the dead.
We came from Caladan — a paradise world for our form of life. There existed no need on Caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mind — we could see the actuality all around us. And the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this life — we went soft, we lost our edge.
What is the son but an extension of the father?
The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes.
Each man is a little war.
One peels a problem like an onion.
What delicious abandon in the sleep of the child. When do we lose it?
One does not risk everything to settle a score prematurely.
Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power.
One enemy at a time.
The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in the basic source of civilization - agriculture.
The young reed dies so easily. Beginnings are times of such peril.
Hard tasks need hard ways.
Beginnings are such delicate times.
To accept a little death is worse than death itself.
At the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.
The absence of a thing, this can be as deadly as the presence. The absence of air, eh? The absence of water? The absence of anything else we're addicted to.
One must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear - sharp and ready.
She looked at patches of blackness. Black is a blind remembering, she thought.
I should’ve suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive.
There's steel in this man that no one has taken the temper out of...
A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Maud'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Maud'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.
The night is a tunnel, she thought, a hole into tomorrow...
The day hums sweetly when you have enough bees working for you.
Above all else, the mentat must be a generalist, not a specialist. It is wise to have decisions of great moment monitored by generalists. Experts and specialists lead you quickly into chaos. They are a source of useless nit-picking, the ferocious quibble over a comma.
O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers.
Scientists seek the lawfulness of events. It is the task of Religion to fit man into this lawfulness.
Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.
Respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. Something cannot emerge from nothing.
God created Arrakis to train the faithful.
Beware! The mind of the believer stagnates. It fails to grow outward into an unlimited, infinite universe.
The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.
When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.
A ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel... he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men... a good ruler has to learn his world's language... it's different for every world... the language of the rocks and growing things... the language you don't hear just with your ears... The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.... Understanding must move with the flow of the process.
The universe is full of doors.
She thought of the boy's features as an exquisite distillation out of random patterns - endless queues of happenstance meeting at this nexus.
I observed you in pain, lad. Pain’s merely the axis of the test. Your mother’s told you about our ways of observing. I see the signs of her teaching in you. Our test is crisis and observation.
“Are you already training my replacement? Piter demanded. "Replace you? Why, Piter, where could I find another Mentat with your cunning and venom?" "The same place you found me, Baron." "Perhaps I should at that," the Baron mused. "You do seem a bit unstable lately. And the spice you eat!" "Are my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them?" "My dear Piter, your pleasures are what tie you to me. How could I object to that?”
When strangers meet, great allowances should be made for differences in custom and training.
The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness.
One should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt.
“You must teach me someday how you do that,” he said. “The way you thrust your worries aside and turn to practical matters. It must be a Bene Gesserit thing.” “It’s a female thing,” she said.
The man without emotions is the one to fear.
Observe the plans within plans within plans.
He who controls the spice controls the universe.
The spice must flow.

The only defense against age is that age attacks all things equally.
The difference between a good administrator and a bad one is about five heartbeats. Good administrators make immediate choices.

The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.
Truth suffers from too much analysis.
The hearts of all men dwell in the same wilderness.
Love is a very ancient force, which served its purpose in its day but no longer is essential for the survival of the species.
To see eternity was to be exposed to eternity's whims, oppressed by endless dimensions.
Memory never recaptures reality. Memory reconstructs. All reconstructions change the original, becoming external frames of reference that inevitably fall short.
The potential richness of a man is to be measured in the space he occupies in the hearts of others.
Respect for bravery must stand higher than the avoidance of administrative shares.
To use knowledge as a weapon is to degrade it.

The true measure of a civilization is in how it treats its lowest citizens.
The more power you have, the more power you want.
The future remains uncertain and so it should, for it is the canvas upon which we paint our desires. Thus always the human condition faces a beautifully empty canvas.
To stay on the path is a character test.
Machine makers always run the risk of becoming totally machine.
Membership in a conspiracy, as in an army, frees people from the sense of personal responsibility.
If you want immortality, then deny form. Whatever has form has mortality. Beyond form is the formless, the immortal.
The best prophets lead you up to the curtain and let you peer through for yourself.
We never get far from wealth and all of its masks when we deal with power.
The old feudal aristocracies relied on land, and they were tied to the land until it killed them... We've moved beyond that.
If you trap the universe in numbers, you must always look straight down the barrel of infinity.
When the lag behind, he is open to self-deceptions.
A powerful enemy is better to have than a tame friend.
When you think to take determination of your fate into your own hands, that is the moment you can be crushed. Be cautious.
If enough of us believe, a new thing can be made to exist. Belief structure creates a filter through which chaos is sifted into order.
You cannot go on forever stealing what you need without regard to those who come after.
In a world so filled with wonders, they have managed to create boredom.
A plan depends as much upon execution as it does upon concept.
Treachery within treachery within treachery.
To save one from a mistake is a gift of paradise.
Given the right lever, you can move a planet.
The spice extends life. The spice expands consciousness. The spice is vital to space travel.
Just as individuals are born, mature, breed, and die, so do societies and civilizations and governments.
You’ve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? There’s an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove the threat to his kind.
Use the first moments in study. You may miss many an opportunity for quick victory this way, but the moments of study are insurance of success. Take your time and be sure.
The gift of words is the gift of deception and illusion.
That is the beginning of knowledge - the discovery of something we do not understand.
Some problems are best solved with an optimistic approach. Optimism shines a light on alternatives that are otherwise not visible.
Bless the Maker and His water. Bless the coming and going of Him. May His passage cleanse the world. May He keep the world for His people.
Such a rich store of myths enfolds Paul Muad'dib, the Mentat Emperor, and his sister, Alia, it is difficult to see the real persons behind these veils. But there were, after all, a man born Paul Atreides and a woman born Alia. Their flesh was subject to space and time. And even though their oracular powers placed them beyond the usual limits of time and space, they came from human stock. They experienced real events which left real traces upon a real universe. To understand them, it must be seen that their catastrophe was the catastophe of all mankind. This work is dedicated, then, not to Muad'dib or his sister, but to their heirs—to all of us.
Every civilization must contend with an unconscious force which can block, betray or countermand almost any conscious intention of the collectivity.
Once more the drama begins.
No matter how exotic human civilization becomes, no matter the developments of life and society nor the complexity of the machine/human interface, there always come interludes of lonely power when the course of humankind, the very future of humankind, depends on the relatively simple actions of single individuals.
You do not beg the sun for mercy.
There's but a thin line between many an enemy and many a friend. Where that line stops, there's no beginning and no end.
The convoluted wording of legalisms grew up around the necessity to hide from ourselves the violence we intend toward each other. Between depriving a man of one hour from his life and depriving him of his life there exists only a difference of degree. You have done violence to him, consumed his energy. Elaborate euphemisms may conceal your intent to kill, but behind any use of power over another the ultimate assumption remains: "I feed on your energy."
Since every individual is accountable ultimately to the self, the formation of that self demands our utmost care and attention.
How seductive it is to live in peace.
Good government never depends upon laws, but upon the personal qualities of those who govern. The machinery of government is always subordinate to the will of those who administer that machinery. The most important element of government, therefore, is the method of choosing leaders.
This is the fallacy of power: ultimately it is effective only in an absolute, limited universe. But the basic lesson of our relativistic universe is that things change. Any power must always meet a greater power. Muad'Dib taught this lesson to the Sardaukar on the Plains of Arrakeen. His descendants have yet to learn the lesson for themselves.
One cannot have a single thing without its opposite.
If you put away those who report accurately, you'll keep only those who know what you want to hear. I can think of nothing more poisonous than to rot in the stink of your own reflections.
If you focus your awareness only upon your own rightness, then you invite the forces of opposition to overwhelm you. This is a common error. Even I, your teacher, have made it.
Peace encourages aggression, thus igniting war.
One learns from books and reels only that certain things can be done. Actual learning requires that you do those things.
Run faster. History is a constant race between invention and catastrophe. Education helps but it's never enough. You must also run.
The wise animal blends into its surroundings.
My mind controls my reality.
The one-eyed view of our universe says you must not look far afield for problems. Such a problem may never arrive. Instead, tend to the wolf within your fences. The packs ranging outside may not even exist.
Any path which narrows future possibilities may become a lethal trap. Humans are not threading their way through a maze; they scan a vast horizon filled with unique opportunities. The narrowing viewpoint of the maze should appeal only to creatures with their noses buried in sand.
Radicals are only to be feared when you try to suppress them. You must demonstrate that you will use the best of what they offer.
"Make no heroes," my father said.
All machines fail or are superseded. Still, the Army worships at the shrine of such things - both fascinated and fearful... In its guts, the Army knows it is the Sorcerer's Apprentice. It unleashes technology and never again can the magic be stuffed back into the bottle.
Technology breeds anarchy. It distributes these tools at random. And with them goes the provocation for violence. The ability to make and use savage destroyers falls inevitably into the hands of smaller and smaller groups until at last the group is a single individual.
The ability to view our futures can become a bore... It has occurred to me more than once that holy boredom is good and sufficient reason for the invention of free will.
Sheathe the blade. Never remove it without drawing blood.
Even ordinary tyrants have motives and feelings beyond those usually assigned them by facile historians... History has a way of magnifying some characteristics while it discards others.
Government is a shared myth. When the myth dies, the government dies.
The expectations which history creates for one generation are often shattered in the next generation.
Some things do not change very much. They are merely taken from one place and reformed in another place.
The mind imposes this framework which it calls "reality." That arbitrary framework has a tendency to be quite independent of what your senses report.
Most people are not creatures of reason.
Any religion circles like a planet around a sun which it must use for its energy, upon which it depends for its very existence.
The universe is timeless at its roots and contains therefore all times and all futures.
The fire never completely goes out.
Police always observe that criminals prosper. It takes a pretty dull policeman to miss the fact that the position of authority is the most prosperous criminal position available.
I will die four deaths - the death of the flesh, the death of the soul, the death of the myth and the death of reason. And all of these deaths contain the seed of resurrection.
Reputation can be a beautiful weapon. It often spills less blood.
Sometimes, Time rushes by me; sometimes, it creeps.
The surest sign that an aristocracy exists is the discovery of barriers against change, curtains of iron or stone or of any substance which excludes the new, the different.
All of us try to evolve, but if something blocks us, we can transfer our potential into pain - seeking it or giving it. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable.
Thrown sand is a profound gesture. It says: "We share the same burden. Sand is our only enemy. This is what we drink. The hand that holds sand holds no weapon."
All people have intentions.
The three legs of the agreement-tripod are desire, data and doubt. Accuracy and honesty have little to do with it... desire brings the participants together. Data sets the limits of their dialogue. Doubt frames the questions.
Argument closes off the doors of the senses... It always masks violence. Continued too long, argument always leads to violence.
How tempting it is to raise high walls and keep out change. Rot here in our own self-satisfied comfort. Enclosures of any kind are a fertile breeding ground for hatred of outsiders. That produces a bitter harvest.
If I choose the good, does that make me good?
When a thing vanishes, that is as much of a message as when a thing suddenly appears. The empty spaces are always worthy of our study.
You don't know what it is to love. What have you ever given?
It's not knowing that conjures up the greatest terrors.
Mobility is the key to military success. If you're tied down in forts, even whole-planet forts, you are ultimately vulnerable.
When logic fails, another tool must be used.
Rot at the core spreads outward.
I warn you that ignorance thrives on hysteria... The undeserving maintain power by promoting hysteria. The Atreides art is the art of ruling without hysteria, the art of being responsible for the uses of power.
If we cannot adjust our differences peacefully we are less than human.
In my estimation, more misery has been created by reformers than by any other force in human history. Show me someone who says, "Something must be done!" and I will show you a head full of vicious intentions that have no other outlet. What we must strive for always is to find the natural flow and go with it.
Nothing surpasses the complexity of the human mind.
Tone of voice and attitude alone can subjugate another's will.
One of the most dangerous things in the universe is an ignorant people with real grievances. That is nowhere near as dangerous, however, as an informed and intelligent society with grievances. The damage that vengeful intelligence can wreak, you cannot even imagine.
I always prepare secondary ways of dealing with problems.
Survival! That's all the noble purpose we need. Survival!
Man is but a pebble dropped in a pool. And if man is but a pebble, then all his works can be no more.
It is your fate, forgetfulness. All of the old lessons of life, you lose and gain and lose and gain again.
No planet, no land or sea, no part of any land or sea is here forever. Wherever we stand, we are only stewards.
Never believe that you have plumbed the depths of any place... or of any human.
Complexity hides within complexity. Great deeds and foul ones have been done at the goading of sexual forces.
You may think of this only as sexuality but we prefer the more basic term: procreation. It has many facets and offshoots and it has apparently unlimited energy. The emotion called "love" is only one small aspect... This energy must have an outlet. Bottle it up and it becomes monstrously dangerous. Redirect it and it will sweep over anything in its path. This is an ultimate secret of all religions.
Laws to suppress tend to strengthen what they would prohibit. This is the fine point on which all the legal professions of history have based their job security.
I know a profound pattern humans deny with words even while their actions affirm it. They say they seek security and quiet, conditions they call peace. Even as they spread, they create seeds of turmoil and violence.
Humans have this deep desire to classify, to apply labels to everything... We lay claim to what we name. We assume an ownership that can be misleading and dangerous.
You cannot know history unless you know how leaders move with its currents. Every leader requires outsiders to perpetuate his leadership.
You cannot manipulate a marionette with only one string.
You cannot know history unless you know how leaders move with its currents. Every leader requires outsiders to perpetuate his leadership.
If I am to die, I must pass along a transcendental lesson. I must leave with serenity.
Always beware of those who fawn upon us, nuzzling up to all of that power we're supposed to have. How flattering to find great mobs of servants waiting and anxious to do our bidding! How utterly debilitating.
We trundle along on borrowed days.
There is nothing humans hate more than the unpredictable.
Whose truth? Modified in what way? In what context?
Names carry magic.
What glue had actually held the Old Empire together? Many things, some small and some large, but mostly economic. Lines of connection thought of often as conveniences. And what kept them from blasting one another out of existence? The Great Convention. "You blast anyone and we blast you."
Trust no government!
Never damage your own nest.
All states are abstractions.
Oh, the perils of leadership in a species so anxious to be told what to do. How little they knew of what they created by their demands. Leaders made mistakes. And those mistakes, amplified by the numbers who followed without questioning, moved inevitably toward great disasters.
The greatest relevancy can become irrelevant in the space of a heartbeat. Mentats should look upon such moments with joy.
Some precious stones can be identified by their impurities. Experts map impurities within the stones. A secret fingerprint. People are like that. You often know them by their defects. The glittering surface tells you too little. Good identification requires you to look deep inside and see the impurities. There is the gem quality of a total being. What would Van Gogh have been without impurities?
Moral decisions are always easy to recognize. They are where you abandon self-interest.
Do not depend only on theory if your life is at stake.
The difference between sentiment and sentimentality is easy to see. When you avoid killing somebody's pet on the glazeway, that's sentiment. If you swerve to avoid the pet and that causes you to kill pedestrians, that is sentimentality.
Moral decisions are always easy to recognize. They are where you abandon self-interest.
The true warrior often understands his enemy better than he understands his friends. A dangerous pitfall if you let understanding lead to sympathy as it will naturally when left unguided.
Never follow a leader without asking your own questions.
Humans can balance on strange surfaces. Even on unpredictable ones. It's called "getting in tune." Great musicians know it. Surfers I watched when I was a child on Gammu, they knew it. Some waves throw you but you're prepared for that. You climb back up and go at it once more.
Uproot your questions from their ground the dangling roots will be seen. More questions!
Power attracts the psychotics. Always. That's what we have to avoid within ourselves.
Beware jargon. It usually hides ignorance and carries little knowledge.
We live in our little congeries like anyone else. Rooms of the mind, rooms of the body.
Creative anarchy is the path to survival in this universe.
Look for the ones who can say "Yes." Never bother with underlings who can only say "No."
Chaos exists as raw material from which to create order.
Paired opposites define your longings and those longings imprison you.
Today is sufficient unto today.
Technology tends toward avoidance of risks by investors. Uncertainty is ruled out if possible. People generally prefer the predictable. Few recognize how destructive this can be, how it imposes severe limits on variability and thus makes whole populations fatally vulnerable to the shocking ways our universe can throw the dice.
Duncan spoke quietly: "Lucilla, if you touch me again without my permission, I will try to kill you. I will try so hard that you very likely will have to kill me."
You seldom learn the names of the truly wealthy and powerful. You see only their spokesmen. The political arena makes a few exceptions to this but does not reveal the full power structure.
Concealed behind strong barriers the heart becomes ice.
The people who demand that the oracle predict for them really want to know next year’s price on whalefur or something equally mundane. None of them wants an instant-by-instant prediction of his personal life.
They learned early that sharing secret or private names was an ancient device for ensnaring a person in affections.
The writing of history is largely a process of diversion. Most historical accounts divert attention from the secret influences around the recorded events.
The great mass of humankind possesses an unmistakable unit-identity. It can be one thing. It can act as a single organism.
Teg boiled it down to an essence: If only one person followed such guiding principles, this was a better universe.
You took the universe as you found it and applied your principles where you could.
Indeed? Pardon me for not listening further but I am really on an urgent errand.
He shook his head, thinking of the Bene Gesserit designs behind those genetic markers in Teg’s face — that hawk look, the crease lines and that inner thing, that certainty of moral superiority. How moral and how superior?
“Only liberals really think. Only liberals are intellectual. Only liberals understand the needs of their fellows.” How much viciousness lay concealed in that word! Odrade thought. How much secret ego demanding to feel superior.
Hatred was as dangerous an emotion as love. The capacity for hatred was the capacity for its opposite.
Forces that we cannot understand permeate our universe. We see the shadows of those forces when they are projected upon a screen available to our senses, but understand them we do not.
Big breasts in a woman and hard loins in a man (that tightly muscular look to the buttocks) — these were naturally important in sexual matchings. But without the eyes, the rest of it could go for nothing. Eyes were essential. You could drown in the right kind of eyes, he had learned, sink right into them and be unaware of what was being done to you until penis was firmly clasped in vagina.
It began with recognition that humans were not created equal, that they possessed different inherited abilities and experienced different events in their lives. This produced people of different accomplishments and different worth.
Sheeana would learn in time that any person who lived through the decision to die evolved a new emotional balance. Fears were transitory.
Curiosity unsatisfied tended to create its own answers. Guesses were often more dangerous than facts.
I can say God, but that is not my God. That is only a noise and no more potent than any other noise.
